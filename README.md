# Jamku Pulse
Unoffical WhatsApp communication client for small offices.
**Jamku Pulse** helps offices with a common WhatsApp number manage and monitor team communication with clients — securely, efficiently, and all within your office network.

Jamku Pulse is currently in **Beta** (as of October 2025)

## 🧑‍💼 For Whom?

Jamku Pulse is designed for **offices that share one WhatsApp number** for all their clients.
It helps you:

* Track which **team member** sent which **message** to which **client**.
* Control which team member can **view or chat** with specific clients.

> This is **not** a marketing or bulk promotion tool — it’s built for **client communication management**.

## 💡 Why This Software?

WhatsApp has certain limitations for team use:

1. It allows only **4 active sessions** at a time.
   → Jamku Pulse uses **just one session** and lets **up to 200 users** access it.
2. WhatsApp has **no user-level tracking** or **access permissions**.
   → Jamku Pulse introduces both — so you know **who sent what**, and **who can see what**.
