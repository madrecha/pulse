# Jamku Pulse
Unoffical WhatsApp communication client for small offices.
**Jamku Pulse** helps offices with a common WhatsApp number manage and monitor team communication with clients — securely, efficiently, and all within your office network.

Jamku Pulse is currently in **Beta** (as of October 2025)

## 🧑‍💼 For Whom?

Jamku Pulse is designed for **offices that share one WhatsApp number** for all their clients.
It helps you:

* Track which **team member** sent which **message** to which **client**.
* Control which team member can **view or chat** with specific clients.

> This is **not** a marketing or bulk promotion tool — it’s built for **client communication management**.

---

## 💡 Why This Software?

WhatsApp has certain limitations for team use:

1. It allows only **4 active sessions** at a time.
   → Jamku Pulse uses **just one session** and lets **up to 200 users** access it.
2. WhatsApp has **no user-level tracking** or **access permissions**.
   → Jamku Pulse introduces both — so you know **who sent what**, and **who can see what**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ **User tracking** – See which team member sent messages to each client.
* 🔐 **Access control** – Restrict visibility of chats to specific team members.
* 💾 **Data privacy** – All data is stored **on your PC**, never leaves your office network.
* 📢 **Bulk messaging** – Send messages to a list of clients in one go.
* 📢 **Message scheduling** – Schedule messages to be sent to clients, one time or regular interval.
* 🏷️ **Client tagging** – Tag clients and filter chats easily.
* 📤 **Export messages** – Export chat data to Excel for analysis or backup.
* 👥 **Multi-user access** – One WhatsApp session, accessible to **up to 200 users** in your office.

> ⚠️ Note: Jamku Pulse is still in **Beta**. Not all features may be available yet.

## ⚙️ How It Works

Jamku Pulse operates through a **single WhatsApp Web session** using secure browser automation.
Here’s how to get started:

1. **Install** Jamku Pulse on one PC in your office.
2. **Scan** the WhatsApp QR code once to link your WhatsApp account.
3. **Run** the software — it will act as a local server.
